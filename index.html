                        <h1>A Brief Introduction of Principal</h1>
                        <p>With more schools and homes adopting Montessori philosophies, “Montessori” has become a word that is often thrown around in parenting and teaching circles. However, while it is widely known to be an alternative childhood educational model, there is still an air of mystery around it. With this comes a lot of misinformation that can make things rather confusing for newcomers.

                            Montessori can be hard to define even for those who have applied its principles at home or have kids that attend Montessori schools. Nevertheless, this article will attempt to demystify it by delving into the various aspects of the Montessori method.</p>

                        <h1>A Brief Introduction of vice Principal</h1>
                        <p>When was the last time you made an appointment to see the School Principal? In a busy secondary school, it is not something that will happen immediately unless the issue is of pressing importance. And when that issue concerns ‘our little Johnny,’ it is always in need of attention here and now.

                          With such a demanding workload, school principals rely on their powers of delegation and nearly all will say that they cannot function without the help of a dedicated vice-principal or two. With their own time being spent on everything from administrative or departmental meetings to planning and responding to arising school situations, it is all the more crucial that the leader ‘broadens his eyes and ears’ to deal with extended matters and stay in touch with the bigger picture. </p>

While it might be the initial stage of their school education and learning, it is one that is amongst the most important. The things students get to learn there are what they carry with them for years to come.


                          LKG is attended by the students at such a tender age when they are extra curious about things. It is only then that they can be taught the numbers, alphabets, etc. that will stick with them throughout their life. This is also the time in a kid’s life when they come up with more of their creativity, with their brains at a developing stage. </p>

Kids spend about 3-4 hours per day in UKG. They get involved in learning activities, various lessons, and fun activities like dancing.

                          In UKG, children learn in a fun way. Teachers teach children in such a way that they can enjoy learning. UKG plays an important role in a kid’s life. At the same time, it is beneficial to learn daily habits and routines. Before UKG, children should join LKG, Lower KinderGarten. Because these three classes are an important part of kids’ schooling.
